        Arch:       amd64-64-little
        RELRO:      游리 Partial RELRO
        Stack:      游릭 Canary found
        NX:         游릭 NX enabled
        PIE:        游댮 No PIE (0x400000)

        IBT:        游릭 Enabled
        Stripped:   游댮 No
```
* as we can see, the binary is not PIE, but very secure, it has a canary, NX bit is enabled, SHSTK is enabled, and IBT is enabled.
* this means that we know the address of all symbols in the binary.

```
* the main function asks for a movie name, reads it from the user, and then prints it back.
* we can see that the buffer is passed as the first argument to the `printf` function, which means that it is valueable to formated string attack.

### formated string attack
* when the user has control over the format string, they can read from the stack and even write to it.
* because of the `%n` format specifier, which writes the number of bytes written so far to the address pointed to by the next argument.
* but what will we write? lets look for symbols in the binary:
```text
Non-debugging symbols:
0x0000000000401000  _init
0x00000000004010f0  putchar@plt
0x0000000000401100  puts@plt
0x0000000000401110  __stack_chk_fail@plt

0x0000000000401316  win
0x000000000040132d  main
0x0000000000401470  __libc_csu_init
0x00000000004014e0  __libc_csu_fini
0x00000000004014e8  _fini
```
* we can see that the binary has a function called `win`. also the puts@plt is a good candidate for a format string attack, as it is used right after the printf function.
* so we will overwrite the got entery of `puts` with the address of the `win` function' so that after the `printf` function is called, the program will jump to the `win` function instead of the `puts` function.
* the payload will look like this:
```text
%4886c%9$lln%42c%10$hhna @@\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00"@@\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00
```
1. `%4886c` will print 4886 (0x1316) bytes, which is the lower bytes of the address of the `win` function.
2. `%9$lln` will write the number of bytes written so far to the address of the 9th argument, which is the address of the `puts` got entry.
3. `%42c` will print 42 bytes, now 0x1340 bytes have been printed.
4. `%10$hhna` will write the lower byte of number of bytes written so far (0x40) to the address of the 10th argument, which is the address of the `puts` got entry + 2.
5. ` @@\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00` will be the address of the `puts` got entry, which is 0x404020.
6. `"@@\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00` will be the address of the `puts` got entry + 2, which is 0x404022.

### why 9th and 10th arguments?
* the c call convention used by the binary is the System V AMD64 ABI, which means that the first six arguments are passed in registers, and the rest are passed on the stack.
* the arguments on the stack are pushed in reverse order, so the first argument is at the top of the stack.
* because our payload is save to a buffer at the top of the stack, is is actually the first (%rdi) and seventh 
(no the stack) arguments. and because on `payload` + 24/32  we save the address of the `puts` got entry, they are the 9th and 10th arguments.

# in "args".  For example, to dump all data sent/received, and disable ASLR
